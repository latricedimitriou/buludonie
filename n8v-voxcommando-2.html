                            <p>What does this mode actually do? Does it move the pixels slightly on all apps or just the watch face for time? I am using a program called Voxcommando (vox wav pro, voice control) and would like to be able to keep the watch screen on at all times without needing to wake the watch first (so I can just touch the display to speak). Secondly I can't actually get Force Burn in to stick, I turn to enable in developer options and after the restart it still show disabled? Thanks.

Hello this is a review I'm doing about presence detection using bluetooth low energy devices that I received from a company called https://www.happybubbles.tech/ for the past 2 weeks I've been working heavily with these devices to understand the ins and outs and test different home automation using them. My current home automation devices are zwave, x10, and phillips hue. I currently use software such as home assistant, voxcommando, eventghost, and tasker to run my home automation devices. 24 ноя 2015  voxcommando урок 1: установка и предварительная настройка  Как настроить IVONA voices 2 + Русский голос Татьяна - Duration:.

Hey Guys, A few weeks ago I posted a thread about what everyone does for a living and realized we have a somewhat diverse group here.

Has anyone tried this or is there a hack for it. I don't wish to use this with Amazons software. However it is great hardware so I would like to use it as a wireless bluetooth microphone if at all possible. Does anyone know if this is possible yet or anyone working on this? I prefer the application voxcommando and have a few things already done using this software.

I've tried using the the Yatse voice recognition but most of the time it is easier to just do it myself. I am wondering if anyone has tried VoxCommando and, if so, what your feedback is? Specifically, I find the Yatse options really limited. I also wish it would let me show the search results and what not on screen in addition to on my phone.

Never really see much mention of the program "voxcommando" on here. I've been using it for years now and still havent found much to rival its power in automating all of my different HA devices.

I purchased 10 stick n find beacons about 6 months ago for 0 and still haven't figured out a way to get these to integrate with my current home automation setup. I'm currently using z-wave modules with vera lite and a few x-10 modules with a cm15a controller. I use evenghost and voxcommando on pc, and tasker on android phone. I've placed each beacon in the center of the room on the ceiling. I then used an apple device to reprogram each beacons UUID as an estimote beacon so that I could. 2:16.

Is there anything like voxcommando or voice attack for linux ? Or is there one that works Программа, которая позволяет управлять ПК голосом. Okay, so, here's my super crazy aspirations (plus some background): I'm a techie and until 'recently' I haven't been keen on programming. However over the past year or so I've been seeing the value in knowing how to program. Web systems are the most obvious candidate, but languages such as C# and Perl Java and God-knows-what-else are good to know, too. I haven't looked much into it before because I have been focused upon the hardware/support side of things rather than programming. It wasn't. Hey - I have seen various windows based solutions to issuing commands to an XBMC home theatre set up using eventghost and voxcommando but have not yet come across a linux way of doing so. Anyone accomplished this and if so what scripts/routines did you use? Current system is ubuntu 12.04 for the htpc. Many thanks. Hello good people! I'm looking for help with an NAS system in preparing to order and setup. I've gone through some parts at pcpartpicker and put together a build that I'm hoping will satisfy my needs. The things that are important to me in this build are sickbeard, couchpotato, headphones, plex server, deluge, sabnzbd, Voxcommando, eventghost, streaming and gaming. This build will likely be going into my electronics closet and have lines ran to my TV in my living room. Hey guys, I have a project i'm working on that using an arduino and processing as it's gui. communication is handled through serial read and write. I want to add voice recognition to the project using VoxCommando ( That software works by communicating with the arduino via the serial port as well. My question is, how do I have two programs communicate with arduino via the same com port? thanks. Hey guys. I want to use voxcommando for speech recognition while at the same time having my processing sketch control an arduino. Vox uses a python script to communicate with arduino via serial. Could I use that same python script with processing. And if so is processing able to communicate with both using different com ports? FYI. Here is a post about the python side of things http://voxcommando.com/forum/index.php?topic=1452.0. 
I just installed VoxCommando ( and EventGhost on my computer to enable awesome voice control. At the moment, it doesn't do a lot, but I haven't had much trouble getting it to do what I've put in so far, which is just a couple typical things ("Nap time" to get it to sleep, "let's get giggity" to open /r/nsfw, "bigify" to maximize, etc.) What are some of your suggestions. </p>
