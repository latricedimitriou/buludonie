Hey guys, I generally like reading the WL recaps from people who make the effort to do one so here is mine! I'm a generally average player (Div 4-5 in Rivals, Gold 3 in WL) and played the WL for the 10th time or so this season with my full Serie A squad I've been building up through SBCs mostly since the start of the season. Here is the squad for those interested (https://imgur.com/a/yoRVzJJ) (Donnarumma 4th IF is the goalkeeper) General Summary: It was a very linear WL as I almost. Ну, а теперь приведем лучшие уже из них — как мне показалось, это английский, французский и испанский варианты (может, просто, потому что я их слегка знаю?). # Respect the Creeper (https://i.imgur.com/G4HYb6m.jpg) --- gt I wake up and find my room swarming with darkness; in papery whispers it insists it belongs to me. I rise from the earth and let the storm scour the grave from my body. Then comes the worst part. When I remember. Something savage and unnatural lurks within me. Something with a hideously twisted mind, its flesh molded from the clay of raw madness. Something -- gt -- screaming to get out. Name: Jack Ryder Affiliation. Хью́стон (англ. Houston, МФА: ˈhjuːstən ) — четвёртый по количеству жителей город в Соединённых Штатах Америки и крупнейший город в штате Техас с населением 2 319 603 человека на 2017 год. Хьюстон. Background Yesterday i was re-building my team bc i struggled a bit after the latest patch. I had red Kolarov as LB and decided to switch to FS Grimaldo, who offers more going forward (and who is a steal for \~80K!). To get him on full chem i thought why not try that UEL Pizzi. Looks solid and has the chance to be upgraded (50:50 i'd say, Frankfurt ist doing well atm). amp#x200B; Key Stats (Maestro on Full Chem) 87 Acceleration 97 Positioning 91 Shot Power 95 Long Shots. 
Загляните в прошлое — славные деяния ваших предков, — это поможет Вам и Вашим потомкам открыть дорогу в будущее. I was fortunate enough to get my hands on an Alaba and was skeptical about using him at first because I would have to change up my entire system to accommodate him and then came the new weekly objectives so I drafted him into my objective XI but good god, this little dynamite has been insane and I am not going back. amp#x200B; He is the perfect midfielder in my opinion and even though I love Pogba in real life, I couldn't get going with Paul in this game, however, Alaba has been everything. # Respect the Creeper () --- gt I wake up and find my room swarming with darkness; in papery whispers it insists it belongs to me.

I just started my second year at Celta Vigo and my goal is to qualify in UEL. Not playing other competitions other than La Liga and Copa del Rey. Rate my team, and tell me - if you happen to know - any IRL transfer rumors regarding Celta. I play with a strange 3412 formation, where one of the two strikers tend to be behind the other one.

Intro At some point in reading or watching TWGOK, you may have noticed that occasionally non-latin, non-japanese symbols are used in writing for Hell. 'Hellian' is actually a pretty simple cipher for the English alphabet, and written in poorly translated English, which (thanks to whoever compiled this ( on the internet) can be decoded with time and patience. As an exercise during my latest re-watching/re-reading I decided to compile and decipher every instan.
