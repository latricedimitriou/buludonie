I've been studying Korean daily for about a year and thought it might be helpful for new learners to hear about my experiences. So, for the next few weeks I'm doing a series of long form posts talking about each resource that I've used.

Published in 1964 by a Colombian Jesuit, its goal is mastery of Latin as a written language, as well as spoken . Together with Most, Latin by the Natural Method (https://cerclelatin.org/wiki/Most_version_anglaise/first-year), it seems to be one of the last witnesses of how Latin could be taught in Catholic institutions when an active knowledge of the language was still a legitimate goal.

I am an intermediate/upper-intermediate learner of Russian. I've been studying in my free time for 3 years, through a combination of independent work, chatting with native speakers, and private lessons. I'm currently working through a series of grammar books that I really like: Let's Improve Our Russian 1-3 by N. Volkova and D. Phillips. (https://www.europeanbookshop.com/languagebooks/series/LETS?notabbr=1ampall=1) The first book in the series is designed for students at a B1-B2 level I kind of flail around more than I'd like to admit when gathering materials. There's a sometimes-large disagreement between what I want to buy and what I can buy. Through a series of Google searches, recommendations in an old book, and advice from friends who've been doing this homeschool thing longer than I, I have discovered that one good answer is antique schoolbooks. During the 19th century, when public school was often difficult or impossible to obtain, there was what seems Voilà my guide that I originally made for my mom who wants to study French. I learned (and am still learning) French by myself and I compiled an extensive list of resources and tips I used which helped me out. DM me if you want a Microsoft Word/Google Docs format instead because it’s easier to read. I hope you’ll find it helpful! ————————————————— 1. Coffee Break French (Podcast) Start here. The instructor is very knowledgeable, engaging, and fun. What also helps is the general structure. UPDATE #2 : I apologize for the delay, as it is taking me longer than I expected to put these together and I am in the middle of moving. Here is a list of what I have posted so far and what I still need to do: - Spanish: _X_ Beginner (https://wordbrewery.com/blog/spanish/fifty-beginning-spanish-sentences-with-ser/) ___ Intermediate - French: _X_ Beginner (https://wordbrewery.com/blog/french/mastering_french_verb_avoir_sentences/) ___ Intermediate - Japanese: _X_ Beginner (https://wordbrewer.

Some background: I started trying to learn Japanese on my own some time back, but I haven't done any practice for some time. My skill level is that of rank beginner; I learned the kana, a few kanji, and a tiny amount of grammar, but much of that has atrophied from non-use over many months. Anyways, I came across a post about Japanese writing in a different sub, replied to it, and have decided to post much of the same info here. The idea is that by doing. Hey guys, I took the placement for this summer's KLEC program at Sogang last week and I thought I'd share my experience while it's still fresh in my memory. Classes start this week and I found out today I was placed into level 4 (was aiming for 3 so it came as a bit of a shock). I know there’s other info on the web already about this but I’m just putting this here in case anyone is interested in attending Sogang in the future and would perhaps like some study tips! I'll skip the basic Please don't use ONLY TTMIK as your sole source of information. I've seen a bunch of people ask "what should I do after TTMIK?" or "how good will I be after I finish the TTMIK levels?" You should be using TTMIk as part of your learning curriculum and supplementing it with other resources. I'm a big TTMIK fan. I've bought three of their books and am subscribed to their YouTube channel. I've met Hyunwoo in real life and he's a great guy. TTMIK's grammar lessons are great as a grammar resource Hey gang! Welcome to the fifth Lets Build  Congrats on completing the NPC Physical Traits (https://www.reddit.com/r/d100/comments/7aec94/d100_physical_npc_traits/) table! A few times a week, I will be posting a Lets Build idea and sticking it on the top of our subreddit. I will post a topic, and in the comments, please feel free to contribute to the list! Once the list is full, I will put the data together and submit it as a list here in the subreddit. Then, I will start a new topic. This is my version of the best Korean resources for beginners. It's an alternative to the list that's posted in the sidebar. #Free Resources Korean has some really good free sites and books available. Check them out. ##Main Resources Talk to Me in Korean's Grammar Lessons ( TTMIK might be the most popular site for learning Korean. All their grammar lessons include audio and a PDF and they go up quite high. The audio is mostly in English though. I want to buy an intermediate Japanese textbook but they all cost too much for me. I saw Minna No Nihongo Intermediate Level 1, Intermediate Japanese: A Grammar and Workbook, Aozora: Intermediate\-Advanced Japanese Communication \(it seams is out of stock on amazon. I'll try to see if I found it on ebay\), J Bridge to Intermediate Japanese \(but in good condition\), Sura\-Sura: A Text for Intermediate Japanese, new kanzen master n3 \(I can afford for one of them but I have them all in pdf\). 
Hey All, I passed the DSH exam with a DSH-3 (highest level) within 12-13 months of learning German. Since I am indebted to others who gave their advice on forums, I wanted to give some quick tips on how I passed the test. First things first, I want to emphasize that I didn't learn German in 12-13 months rather I learned DSH-German so to speak. Furthermore, I still make many grammatical mistakes when I speak. The road to improving/learning German continues and will not end for a couple Preface : Hopefully this isn't breaking any of the subreddit rules, I read them and I don't think it will be. My hope is that this can provide some clarification for people first starting out or fairly early on in their learning process trying to make decisions about where to focus, because it can be very overwhelming and there's no single authority on the subject. These are my personal, subjective opinions. Feel free to disagree, and I've missed a good resource, please let me know. Backgroun. So Ive been using the integrated Korean series to learn Korean. I use the workbooks too and I already finished beginning 1. I'm currently a quarter way through beginning 2 and the workbook along with writing journal entries and using hellotalk for checking them and workbook answers and practicing what I learn. I occasionally use ttmik PDFs for simple grammar references in cases where I may not understand the way a grammar point was taught in the textbook I use but the thing Hiya. I thought I'd share some Spanish resources that aren't so well-known. Hopefully they will help some of you. :) Easy Verb Tenses ( This website describes progressive, perfect, and perfect progressive tenses in an easy-to-understand manner.
