Yo. Big NFS and Midnight Club Fan. Payback is just a few weeks away and I'm just excited about the new game! A few months ago, I wanted to make and share a custom playlist on Spotify that would be a better fit for the game because I think that EA's music pick kinda lackluster (Not bad, just could be better). Inspired by past NFS scores, as well as music from specific titles such as Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, Midnight Club Los Angeles amp GTA V's Radio Station feature, I wanted to make a genre. –ì–æ–Ω–∫–∏ –±–µ–∑ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª –í–µ—Å—å –õ–æ—Å-–ê–Ω–¥–∂–µ–ª–µ—Å –ø—Ä–µ–≤—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–ª—Å—è –≤ –≥–æ–Ω–æ—á–Ω—ã–π –ø–æ–ª–∏–≥–æ–Ω: —É–ª–∏—Ü—ã, —à–æ—Å—Å–µ, –ø–∞—Ä–∫–æ–≤–∫–∏ –∏ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—É–ª–∫–∏. –í–∞–º –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–æ–∏—Ç –ø—Ä–æ–π—Ç–∏ –ø—É—Ç—å –æ—Ç –Ω–æ–≤–∏—á–∫–∞ –¥–æ —Å–∞–º–æ–≥–æ –∑–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–∏—Ç–æ–≥–æ.

I wanted to talk about where Rockstar could be going in the future.

EDIT: realtalk: I think I was wrong. u/crimson_devil 's explanation (https://www.reddit.com/r/rockstar/comments/4lw3kd/rockstar_websites_code_sort_of_reveals_2_upcoming/d3yi0ve) actually makes a lot more sense and is totally possible.

Two things: 1.) So I'm moving from southern Oregon, where there is no sales tax, to southern California, where there is sales tax. I am wanting to purchase Forza 5: Game of the Year Edition, but was curious if purchasing it while still in Oregon will avoid paying a sales tax that I might need to pay, if purchased in Los Angeles. Is paying sales tax on digital purchase something I will be looking at in the future because of my new location? Thank you for any information. 2.)
