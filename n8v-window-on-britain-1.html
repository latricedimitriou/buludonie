Im not an innocent child by any means. I've been seeing, doing, and intentionally watching things that many would consider "adult" since I was little. I've seen extreme violence, emotional and physical, and I've also seen things of a horror and sexual nature. Being no stranger to mature content, I've always just watched things that I wanted to, regardless of their content. Recently, I started to watch shows that had a horror/thriller vibe. As one of these shows, I watched Black Mirror. </p>
